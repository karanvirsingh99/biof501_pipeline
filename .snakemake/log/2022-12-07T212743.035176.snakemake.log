MissingOutputException in rule munge_and_ldsc  in line 1 of /Users/karanvir/Desktop/biof501_pipeline/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/LDSCoutput.RData
results/AN.sumstats.gz
results/BMI.sumstats.gz
results/BMI_munge.log
results/AN_munge.log completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 0
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
