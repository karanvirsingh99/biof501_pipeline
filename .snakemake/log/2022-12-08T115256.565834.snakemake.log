MissingOutputException in rule clip_stats  in line 1 of /Users/karanvir/Desktop/biof501_pipeline/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
data/summary_stats/BMI.subset.tsv.gz completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 0
Removing output files of failed job clip_stats since they might be corrupted:
data/summary_stats/AN_subset.tsv.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
